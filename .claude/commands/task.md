# Best Practices Reminder

Respect claude.md, use MCP servers to assist, delegate to one of our coding agents (@agent-fast-coding-agent [simple tasks], @agent-coding-agent [medium complexity] or @agent-complex-coding-agent [high-complexity]) when possible, spawn as many as needed. Use modern .net9+ syntax when possible.
