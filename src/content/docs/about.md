# About Brendan Kowitz

## Professional Background

I'm a software developer at **Microsoft**, where I work on building innovative solutions that make a difference. My journey in tech has been driven by a passion for solving complex problems and creating tools that help people.

### Health Data & FHIR Expertise

For the past **7+ years**, I've been deeply involved in the healthcare technology space, specifically working with **FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources)**. This work has given me a unique perspective on:

- **Health data interoperability** - Making different healthcare systems communicate effectively
- **Standards-based development** - Building robust solutions that follow industry standards
- **Patient data privacy** - Ensuring sensitive health information is handled responsibly
- **Healthcare workflows** - Understanding the real-world needs of clinicians and healthcare organizations

### What I Do at Microsoft

By day, I'm focused on enterprise software development, working with talented teams to deliver solutions that scale. The challenges of building software at this level have taught me invaluable lessons about:

- Architecture and design patterns
- Performance optimization
- Security best practices
- Team collaboration and code quality

### Management & Team Leadership

Beyond coding, I'm passionate about the people side of technology. Building great software requires building great teams, and I've learned valuable lessons about:

- **Growing engineers** - Helping team members develop their skills and advance their careers
- **Technical leadership** - Balancing hands-on work with guiding others
- **Team dynamics** - Creating environments where people do their best work
- **Decision making** - Navigating trade-offs and making calls with incomplete information

## Vibecoding & AI

By night, I'm exploring the exciting frontier of **AI-assisted development** - what I like to call "vibecoding." This isn't just about using AI tools; it's about fundamentally rethinking how we approach software creation.

### My AI Development Journey

I believe we're at an inflection point in software development. AI assistants are becoming powerful collaborators that can:

- Accelerate routine coding tasks
- Help explore new technologies and frameworks
- Provide different perspectives on problem-solving
- Enable rapid prototyping and experimentation

This blog is partly a documentation of that journey - experimenting with AI tools, sharing what works, and exploring what's possible.

## Why This Blog?

I started **kowitz.net** as a place to:

1. **Share knowledge** - Document learnings from health data, FHIR, and AI development
2. **Connect with others** - Engage with the developer community
3. **Think out loud** - Writing helps clarify thinking and solidify understanding
4. **Build in public** - Show the process, not just the polished results

## Get in Touch

I'm always interested in connecting with fellow developers, healthcare technologists, and AI enthusiasts.
