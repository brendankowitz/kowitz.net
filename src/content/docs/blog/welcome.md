# Welcome to kowitz.net

Hello and welcome to my personal blog! I'm Brendan Kowitz, a software developer at Microsoft with a passion for health data interoperability and AI-assisted development.

## Why Start a Blog in 2025?

With so many ways to share content these days, you might wonder why I'm starting a traditional blog. Here's my thinking:

### Long-Form Thinking

Social media is great for quick updates, but some ideas need more space to breathe. A blog gives me room to:

- Explore topics in depth
- Share code examples and technical details
- Document my learning journey over time

### Ownership

Having my own domain means I control my content. It's a small piece of the internet that's truly mine.

### Community

Some of the most valuable resources in my career have been developer blogs. I've learned so much from others who took the time to write about their experiences. This is my way of giving back.

## What to Expect

I plan to write about:

### Health Data & FHIR

After 7+ years working with FHIR and health data systems, I have a lot to share:

- Practical implementation tips
- Lessons learned from real-world projects  
- The evolving landscape of healthcare interoperability

### AI-Assisted Development

The way we write software is changing. I'm exploring:

- How AI tools fit into professional development workflows
- The art of "vibecoding" - collaborating with AI to create software
- What works, what doesn't, and what's coming next

### Software Engineering

General insights from building software at scale:

- Architecture decisions and trade-offs
- Code quality and maintainability
- Working effectively in teams

### Management & Leadership

Thoughts on the people side of technology:

- Growing and mentoring engineers
- Building effective teams
- Navigating the transition from IC to leadership

## Built with Modern Tools

This site itself is an example of what I want to explore. It's built with:

- **Astro** - A modern static site generator that's fast and developer-friendly
- **Starlight** - Astro's documentation theme, repurposed for blogging
- **Azure Static Web Apps** - Microsoft's hosting solution for static sites

I chose these tools because they represent a clean, modern approach to web development - exactly the kind of thing I want to write about.
