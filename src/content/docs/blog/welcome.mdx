Hello and welcome!
I'm Brendan Kowitz, and it's been a good little while since I've [blogged in any capacity](https://web.archive.org/web/20150214041231/http://www.kowitz.net/). But here's the thing - in that stretch of time, our world of software engineering has changed *completely*.

I've spent the last 10 years at Microsoft, with a good portion of that working on creating services to store health data (mostly in FHIR format). Think electronic health records, patient data interoperability, and the complex challenge of making healthcare systems talk to each other, watching the FHIR Standard trickle into regulation, and being part of healthcare's adoption of cloud-based services.

With the rise of ML, then AI, and now agentic workflows, I feel we have the capacity to solve problems and iterate faster than ever before. The tools we're building today at a speed that would have seemed like science fiction just a few years ago.

In any case, thanks for stopping by! Whether you're here to explore the intersection of healthcare tech and AI, dive into software architecture patterns, or just see what happens when you give a developer a blog and too much coffee, I'm glad you're here. I'll be sharing lessons learned, thoughts about interoperability standards, and hopefully some insights that make your own engineering journey a bit easier. Bookmark, subscribe, or just check back when you need a break from Stack Overflow or ChatGPT. Let's build something interesting together.

*— Brendan*
